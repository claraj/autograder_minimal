"""

Quick-and-dirty script for downloading, building, and grading Java class assignments

To do: replace the text in classlist.txt with a list of your own student github login names

To use: provide your org name,  the repo prefix, and the grades JSON filename as arguments, for example:

python grader.py mctc_itec assignment_7_classes week_7.json

TODO: either check modification dates for the test files and grades JSON file
OR copy in the original test files/grades JSON to prevent cheating, or students modifying tests.

The file system stuff may not work on Windows. Modify if needed.

If the student's code is already downloaded, it won't be graded.
Suggest deleting any downloaded code for this assignment and downloading everying fresh.

A lot of output is dumped into raw_output.txt.

Requires Python 3.7 or later. Updgrade if it's failing on the capture_output argument in subprocess.run.
